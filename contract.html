    <h2>Contract</h2>
     <p>I, <em><a href="introduction.html">Adeolu T. Abiodun</a></em>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB250: Database Driven Websites with my instructor, Dr. Von Briesen.</p>
     <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
     <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
     <p>Signed: <em>Adeolu T. Abiodun, 14 August, 2024</em></p>
